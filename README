## Database architecture for Restaurant delivery service

This repo is the result of a student project at Grenoble INP - Ensimag, UGA.

Due to technical issue with the database support during the development, the demonstrator is not fully tested. However, you will find the complete documentation (in french) in the `rapport.pdf` file.

## Use the demonstrator

1. In the `demo/Loader.java` file, fill in the valid credential to access your data base.
2. Create the datastructure using the `sql_script/create.sql` script.
3. Populate the database using `sql_script/populate.sql` or with your own data. Make sure at least one `Client` is registered.
4. Run `EndUI.java` using an IDE or command line.
5. Connect as one of registerd `Client`.
